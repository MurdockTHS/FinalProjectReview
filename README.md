# FinalProjectReview

This is my review for my final project


## Project Experience
The Project SDLC can be seen here [OddJobsApp](https://github.com/MurdockTHS/OddJobs)

## Code and Architecture
This program is in C#,Javascript, and SQL

## Product Demo
Product demo will be through local machine(visual studio)

## Lessons Learn
What I did right is asking other students in the cohort for help.

What I did wrong was my approach to my project. I usually just went straight into coding and did not really plan and it would have prevented many headaches.

Where I was lucky was with CSS. I have almost no confidence in my CSS "skills" but it did not give me any problems for this project.

What would you change is my project entirely. I had no motivation to work on it and it was painful to look at it everyday.
